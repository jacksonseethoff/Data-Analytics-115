# Seattle Crime
# MOTIVATING QUESTION:
My motivating quesiton is what is the most dangerpus area in seattle. 

# DATA SOURCE:
I got my data from the Seattle Police Department website, http://www.seattle.gov/police . This data is from 2008 to the present (2020).   

# PROCESSING STEPS:
I had to begin by downloading the data off of the Seattle Police Departments website. I then had to convert the file to a CSV so that I could transport in to the Jupyter Notebook because it was not readable in the format that it was downloaded in. The majority of the data that came in wasn't numerical so that was the first challenge in order to make the data ready for processing. I had to change how the data was shown so that it listed the count for each different offense per precinct (see "Proccessing Numerical Data"). From there I could use the data to figure out what I was trying to answer.

# VISUALIZATION:
I have put four visualizations on here, which I think best summarises the data and gives me the best answer to my question. When I was deciding what visualizations to show I thought to myself, what are the crimes that make people think a city or area is dangerous. I decided to have visualizations for assult, homicide, and sexual assult in addition to the total number of arrests all distinguished by pricinct.

# Analysis:
In order to find out what areas were the safest and most dangerous, I had to figure out where the certain crimes were taking place. I had to create a pivot table with the counts of all the offences per pricinct. From there I could begin to see where the crimes were actually taking place. I decided to make bar graphs to best show the amount of crimes per area. The results all agree for the most part, except for the homicedes. Assults, sex offences and total number of crimes all point to the North and West being the most dangerous. When you look at homicides, it points to the South pricinct being the most dangerous. That leads one to wonder because homicide is the most dangerous of all the crimes. That being said, the data as a whole pushes one to believe that the North and West are the most dangerous leaveing the South West pricinct as the safest.
