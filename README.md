# Seattle Crime
# MOTIVATING QUESTION:
My motivating quesiton was what is the safest area in seattle. I figured that in order to figure this out, I would also have to find the most dangerous area in seattle.

# DATA SOURCE:
I got my data from the Seattle Police Department website, http://www.seattle.gov/police . This data is from 2008 to the present (2020).   

# PROCESSING STEPS:
I had to begin by downloading the data off of the Seattle Police Departments website. I then had to convert the file to a CSV so that I could transport in to the Jupyter Notebook because it was not readable in the format that it was downloaded in. The majority of the data that came in wasn't numerical so that was the first challenge in order to make the data ready for processing. I had to change how the data was shown so that it listed the count for each different offense per precinct (see "Personal data set - DATA PROCCESSING STEP"). From there I could use the data to figure out what I was trying to answer.
